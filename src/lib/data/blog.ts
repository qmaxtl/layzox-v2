        heading: "The choice paradox",
        body: "More vendors should mean better outcomes. In practice, it means more time spent comparing, negotiating and chasing. Every additional option adds cognitive load and risk of a bad pick. For procurement teams running 20 services across multiple sites, the market is not an asset — it is the problem.",

      {
        heading: "What managed procurement changes",
        body: "In a managed model you submit one requirement. A platform that is accountable for the outcome handles sourcing, selection, scheduling, quality and payment. You exchange infinite choice for accountable outcomes — a trade that operations leaders increasingly make willingly.",

        heading: "The accountability gap",
        body: "In a marketplace, when a vendor underperforms, you have no recourse beyond a rating that changes nothing. In managed procurement, the platform is the one you hold accountable for a fix. That single shift in accountability transforms how businesses plan services.",
